# Facial-Emotion-Recognition

This is a Facial Emotion Recognition program that works real time . I decided to create this program to further expand my knowledge on CNN and face detection . I didn't code the face detection part from scratch but the CNN model architecture was completely my own using Keras Python Library . This model achieves 61% accuracy which is not very good but also not bad . I think there is room for improvement by modifiying the architecture a bit or by using Transfer Learning.
